                </p>
                <p>
                    AAA is a logistics company and broker of motor carrier transportation services duly licensed by the
                    United States Department of Transportation (MC#722349). From time to time, shipments of property
                    provided by AAA'S customers ("SHIPPER") require the services of a motor carrier for the purpose of
                    transporting commodities between points in the continental United States;
                    CARRIER is engaged in the transportation of property by motor vehicle, and is duly licensed by the
                    United States Department of Transportation as a contract carrier (MC# ____________), and;
                    AAA desires to engage the services of CARRIER to arrange the transportation of SHIPPER's goods as set
                    forth on any and all Load Confirmation Sheets and/or bills of lading, which shall hereinafter be referred to
                    as "Load Sheet."
                </p>
                <p>
                    In consideration of the premises and mutual benefits to be derived by CARRIER and AAA from this
                    Agreement and the mutual promises made and exchanged, CARRIER and AAA agree as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span class="text-highlight">CARRIER’S Operating Authority and Compliance with Law</span>: CARRIER represents and warrants that it is
                            duly and legally qualified to provide, as a contract carrier, the transportation services contemplated
                            herein. CARRIER further represents and warrants that it does not have a conditional or
                            unsatisfactory safety rating issued from the U.S. Department of Transportation, and further agrees
                            to comply with all federal, state, and local laws regarding the provision of the transportation
                            services contemplated under this Agreement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="text-highlight">Performance of Services</span>: CARRIER agrees, subject to availability and legal loading capacity of
                            its equipment, to transport commodities and perform ancillary services tendered to it by AAA
                            in accordance with the shipping instructions as set forth in each Load Sheet. CARRIER agrees
                            that it will not use equipment to haul food or food products that had just previously or prior to 
                            being used to transport refuge, garbage, trash or solid liquid waste of any kind whatsoever,
                            whether hazardous or non-hazardous. CARRIER agrees that it will use only tractors, trailers and
                            other equipment which are in good condition and are clean, sound and free from odors,
                            moisture and other conditions that might result in loss or damage to or adverse effect upon the
                            goods transported. CARRIER and AAA agree that each shipment to be transported under this
                            Agreement will be evidenced by a separate Load Sheet, which Load Sheet will become a part of
                            this Agreement when CARRIER accepts a shipment and commences the movement of freight.
                            CARRIER agrees to use all of its own equipment and employees in the performance of services.
                            CARRIER is responsible for obtaining all employment benefits, certifications, and insurance, including
                            workers compensation insurance, as necessary, for operation of its business.

                            <span class="text-highlight">Rates and Charges</span>: AAA will compensate CARRIER for the transportation services performed
                            hereunder on the basis of rates and charges set forth on each Load Sheet. CARRIER represents
                            and warrants that there are no other applicable rates or charges except those established in
                            this Agreement or in any Load Sheet prepared by AAA. CARRIER must provide a completed
                            invoice together with all of the signed original bill(s) of lading, signed pickup receipts and signed
                            proof of delivery receipt(s) for each shipment included on the invoice. AAA shall remit payment
                            to CARRIER for each load tendered within thirty (30) days of receipt by AAA of all properly
                            executed paperwork for the load, as determined solely by AAA. AAA is responsible for all
                            payments to CARRIER for all services rendered by the CARRIER. CARRIER shall not look to SHIPPER
                            for payment and SHIPPER's payments for services rendered will always be made directly to
                            AAA. CARRIER must maintain contact with AAA at all times during which a load is being
                            transported; a copy of its operating authority showing it to be a contract carrier, certificates of
                            insurance in effect as of the date of each shipment, all forms required by the IRS and a signed
                            Carrier-Broker Agreement. Failure to provide these documents will result in delays in the
                            payment of all invoices from the CARRIER.

                            <span class="text-highlight">Effective Date and Term</span>: This Agreement shall go into effect on the day and year herein above
                            written and remain in effect for a period of one (1) year from date hereof, and shall renew
                            automatically for one (1) year periods thereafter, subject to the right of either party hereto to
                            cancel or terminate the Agreement upon not less than thirty (30) days written notice of one
                            party to the other prior to the end of the then current term, with notice being effective upon

                            Agreement. CARRIER specifically agrees that it shall not reveal the terms on which it provides
                            transportation to any third party represented by AAA and/or the consignee/consignors of any

                            <span class="text-highlight">Non-Solicitation by CARRIER</span>: During the term of this Agreement and for the period of twelve (12)
                            months from its termination, CARRIER shall not directly or indirectly, solicit or do business of a
                            transportation nature with any of AAA'S customers who are served by CARRIER as a result of this
                            Agreement. Solicitation prohibited under this Agreement means participation in any conduct,
                            whether direct or indirect, the purpose of which involves transportation or handling of property
                            by CARRIER for which CARRIER does, or did in the past, provide such services for that customer
                            under arrangements first made or procured by AAA. If CARRIER performs services of a
                            transportation nature for compensation for any customer of AAA without prior written authorization
                            from AAA, CARRIER shall immediately pay to AAA an amount equal to twenty (20) percent of all gross
                            revenues invoiced by CARRIER to the solicited customer for a period of eighteen (18) months
                            following the first independent service of customer by CARRIER. AAA shall identify its
                            customers to CARRIER as each first load from each customer is tendered to CARRIER. CARRIER'S
                            acceptance of the load and movement of the property will acknowledge that this new customer
                            is AAA'S customer. This provision will survive the termination of this Agreement.

                            <span class="text-highlight">Sub-Contract Prohibition</span>: CARRIER specifically agrees that all freight tendered to it by AAA shall

                            shall not in any manner sub-contract, broker, or in any other form arrange for the freight to be
